# Kaggle-Quora-Questions-Pairs
My approach to the popular Kaggle Quora Question Pairs problem ( Work in Progress )

The problem can be found <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs">here</a>

Here I have experimented with the muliple similarity measures such as the following and compared their individual performances : 
<ul>
<li>Cosine Similarity</li>
<li>Jacard Similarity</li>
<li>Multiple fuzzy ratios :</li>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy QRatio</li>
<li>Fuzzy WRatio</li>
<li>Fuzzy Partial Ratio</li>
<li>Fuzzy Token Set Ratio</li>
</ul>
</ul>

Some other features that I have used are :
<ol>
<li>Number of Shared words</li>
<li>Total Number of words</li>
<li>Length of each question</li>
</ol>
